# Number Summation Puzzle — Expo Demo

This is a minimal Expo + TypeScript skeleton containing the core components for the Number Summation Puzzle proof-of-concept:
- `Cell`, `Grid`, `TargetDisplay`, `GameScreen`
- Reanimated-based animations and gesture handler usage (basic)

## Run
1. `yarn` or `npm install`
2. `npx expo start`
3. Open in Expo Go or run on emulator.

Note: Install `react-native-reanimated` per its installation docs (babel plugin is already included).
